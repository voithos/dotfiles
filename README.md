dotfiles
========

An organic configuration.

Installing
----------

First, clone the project:

    cd
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/voithos/dotfiles.git .dotfiles

Then, simply execute the `install` script, and Dotbot will do the rest:

    cd .dotfiles
    ./install

Most things should be set-up after that (assuming that there were no linking
errors; Dotbot will not overwrite existing files) - all you have to do now is
just start up Vim, and NeoBundle will prompt you to install the plugins.

Success!
